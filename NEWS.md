Release 2.0-r275 (8 August 2017)
--------------------------------

This release is identical to version 2.0rc1, except the version number. It is
described and evaluated in the following technical report:

 * Li, H. (2017). Minimap2: fast pairwise alignment for long DNA sequences.
   [arXiv:1708.01492v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01492v1).

(2.0: 8 August 2017, r275)



Release 2.0rc1-r232 (30 July 2017)
----------------------------------

This release improves the accuracy of long-read alignment and added several
minor features.

 * Improved mapping quality estimate for short alignments containing few seed
   hits.

 * Fixed a minor bug that affects the chaining accuracy towards the ends of a
   chain. Changed the gap cost for chaining to reduce false seeding.

 * Skip potentially wrong seeding and apply dynamic programming more frequently.
   This slightly increases run time, but greatly reduces false long gaps.

 * Perform local alignment at Z-drop break point to recover potential inversion
   alignment. Output the SA tag in the SAM format. Added scripts to evaluate
   mapping accuracy for reads simulated with pbsim.

This release completes features intended for v2.0. No major features will be
added to the master branch before the final v2.0.

(2.0rc1: 30 July 2017, r232)



Release r191 (19 July 2017)
---------------------------

This is the first public release of minimap2, an aligner for long reads and
assemblies. This release has a few issues and is generally not recommended for
production uses.
